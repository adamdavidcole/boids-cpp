# Boids in OpenFrameworks

I explored a series of experiments using boids as the basic building block. These projects had two _types_ of boids:
1. Fish who flock together
2. Sharks who move alone and repel existing fish

The terms "fish" and "shark" were abstract terms for the two basic behaviors. I built a GUI control for the intensity of certain actions like seperation, cohesion, alignment, and speed.

Using that setup, I began to explore different textures and visuals I could create by playing with those settings

I also explored visualizing these interactions in 3D, playing with a moving light source that was a part of the flock:

Lastly, I tried to create a drawing tool where I could create novel graphics using the boids as a brush:
